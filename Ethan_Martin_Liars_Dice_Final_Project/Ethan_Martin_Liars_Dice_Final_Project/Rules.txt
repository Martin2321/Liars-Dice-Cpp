Rules of Liar's Dice:
	
	The first player calls out two numbers.
	These numbers represent the amount of dice he believes show a certain value.
	For example, player one could call out "two fives".
	Players are allowed to bluff.
	
	Next, the other players can decide to accept his call and move onto the next player's call.
	If the call is accepted, player two gets to make his call.
	Player two's call has to be greater in quantity than what player one called.
	For example, if player one calls out "two five", player two must call out a value of three or higher.
	Player two could call "three fives" or "four twos", but not "two sixes" or "one three".

	The players can also call out the player for his call.
	When a player is called out, all dice are revealed.
	If player one is correct in his call, he wins.
	If player one is incorrect in his call, the player who calls him out is the winner.

	Gameplay continues until someone is called out.
